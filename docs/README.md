### 3. `implementation_plan.md`
**Actionable 2-week implementation plan** for:
- **Week 1:** Adding 7 new maze generation algorithms (Kruskal's, Prim's, Wilson's, Eller's, Binary Tree, Sidewinder, Hunt-and-Kill)
- **Week 2:** Building comprehensive benchmarking suite with visualizations, reports, and CLI tool

Complete with:
- Day-by-day breakdown
- Ready-to-use code examples
- Test strategies
- Success criteria
- Next steps

## Current Focus

**Phase 1 (2 weeks):** Implementing #1 (More Algorithms) + #15 (Benchmarking Suite)

This provides the foundation for future enhancements like AI training, competitive gaming, or game development tools.

## Getting Started

See `implementation_plan.md` for detailed instructions on implementing the new algorithms and benchmarking suite.
